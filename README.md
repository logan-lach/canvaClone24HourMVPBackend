My attempt at completing Gauntlet AI's first challenge of Cohort 3.

## MVP Requirements (24 Hours)

This is a hard gate. To pass the MVP checkpoint, you must have:

- [x] Basic canvas with pan/zoom - Total time to complete 1:55:13
- [ ] At least one shape type (rectangle, circle, or text)
- [ ] Ability to create and move objects
- [ ] Real-time sync between 2+ users
- [ ] Multiplayer cursors with name labels
- [ ] Presence awareness (who's online)
- [ ] User authentication (users have accounts/names)
- [ ] Deployed and publicly accessible

## Focus

The focus is on collaborative infrastructure.

## Philosophy

The MVP isn't about features â€” it's about proving your foundation is solid. A simple canvas with bulletproof multiplayer is worth more than a feature-rich canvas with broken sync.
